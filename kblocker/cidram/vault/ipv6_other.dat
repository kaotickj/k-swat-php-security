# ASN 174 ("Cogent Communications").

# Myself and others have seen and experienced a significant amount of unwanted traffic from their ASN in the past (hack
# attempts, spamming, scraping, various forms of general malicious activity, etc), and generally, IPs sending out this
# type of traffic should be blocked, but unfortunately, their ASN is very widely-encompassing and interlaces
# significantly with with a number of benign, innocent ISPs, human endpoint connections (A/DSL connections, etc), as
# well as with backbone architecture and various IPs and CIDRs that we definitely shouldn't be blocking.

# Because of this, I'm splitting their ASN into multiple sections pertaining the things that we wan't to block, as
# opposed to just listing their ASN in entirety. Sections will be split across ipv[46].dat + ipv[46]_isps.dat +
# ipv[46]_other.dat accordingly.
