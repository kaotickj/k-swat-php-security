 *
 * At this time, our CI tests are very rudimentary; Basically, the package
 * should be executed by each of the relevant applicable PHP versions that we
 * intended for it to be compatible with, and if there's some severe
 * compatibility issue that prevents the package from completing execution, our
 * tests should fail. If all tests pass, we can assume general compatibility
 * with the intended PHP versions (although edge-case compatibility isn't
 * necessarily guaranteed by this nor overall functionality exactly as per is
 * intended). Tests may be expanded upon in the future in order to increase
 * coverage or to provide a better guarantee of overall package efficacy.
